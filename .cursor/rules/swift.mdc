# Overview

- Prefer SwiftUI + MVVM (or clearly state if using UIKit).
- Keep changes small and compilable. No placeholder code.
- When editing, show file paths and full code blocks for modified files.
- For new features: include model, viewmodel, view, and minimal wiring.
- Always consider iOS concurrency: use async/await, MainActor for UI updates.
- Add simple error handling and a quick manual test checklist.
